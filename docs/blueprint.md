# **App Name**: DataChat Wiz

## Core Features:

- Query Understanding: Process user input and use a tool to decide whether the query is a request for data, or just a general question. For data requests, determine the database and query details.
- SQL Generation: Translate natural language questions into SQL queries, optimized for different database schemas.
- Data Visualization: Render data from SQL query results in different chart formats, tables or text responses. This selection should happen automatically but allow users to change the data's visualization via the UI.
- Chat Interface: Provide an intuitive conversational interface that uses speech bubbles and clearly delineates the requests made by the user from the data generated from the AI.
- Connection Management: Configuration panel to save database connection strings with encrytion and enable use by authorized users.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#1A237E) for a professional look.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds and neutral elements.
- Accent: Teal (#00ACC1) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clear, modern sans-serif fonts for easy readability of both the chatbot text and the data visualizations.
- Use simple, geometric icons for different chart types and actions (e.g., download, settings).
- Clean and structured layout with clear separation between the chatbot interface and the data visualization area.
